class User(object):
    passclass User(object):
    pass# login_gui
It is a Gui Package. In the gui you can specify the user with password. There is a possibility to save the entered data. This is stored in the User Data section of Windows. The class is a singleton and returns the last entered data with every call in the process.

Example code:
```python
from login_gui import MainGui, User

if __name__ == '__main__':
    functions = [
        "test function",
        "test function 1",
        "test function 2",
    ]
    print(MainGui(functions, 'My Gui').result)
>>> [1,0,1]
    print(MainGui([], 'My Gui').result)
>>> None
    print(str(User().decode()))
>>> 'user:password'
```
